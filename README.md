# Facial Emotion Recognition

* Implemented 3 feature descriptors (SIFT, ORB, HOG) and 3 classifiers (SVM, KNN, MLP).
* Applied every combination of these algorithms for facial emotion recognition.
* Applied Convolutional Neural Network for facial emotion recognition.
* Compared the results of all the models.
* Tested the best model on a video.

## Packages
**Python Version**: 3.8.3

**Main Packages used**:
* torch==1.8.1
* torchvision==0.9.1

## Conclusion 
* CNN significantly outperforms the other models although it requires a lot of computation.
